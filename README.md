# StudentRegistration
1. Overview
The program is a Spring Boot web application that manages user registrations, updates, and deletions. It utilizes JSP for rendering the UI and follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The application supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user entities.

2. Key Components
 a. Controllers (RegistrationController)
    .viewHomePage(): Renders the homepage (index.jsp).
    .showSignUpForm(Model model): Displays the registration form (register.jsp) with a new User 
      object.
    .processRegister(): Handles registration form submission. It creates a new User object,saves it to the database, and returns a success view (register_sucess.jsp).
    .listUsers(): Retrieves a list of all users and displays them in the list_users.jsp.
    .showUpdateForm(Long id, Model model): Retrieves a user by ID for updating and displays the form (update_user.jsp).
    .processUpdate(User updatedUser): Updates user details and redirects to the list of users.
deleteUser(Long id): Deletes a user by ID and redirects to the list of users.
b. Service Layer (UserService)
    .Manages user operations:
        .saveUser(User user): Saves or updates a user.
        .findUserByEmail(String email): Retrieves a user by email.
        .getAllUsers(): Fetches all users from the database.
        .findUserById(Long id): Retrieves a user by ID.
        .deleteUserById(Long id): Deletes a user by ID.
c. Repository Layer (UserRepository)
    .Extends JpaRepository to provide data access methods.
    .Custom query findByEmail(String email) fetches a user by email.
d. Entity (User)
    .Represents the user table in the database with fields: id, first_name, last_name, email, and password.
    .Includes getters and setters for encapsulating user properties.
3. Views
  The UI is implemented using JSP pages with Bootstrap for styling:

    .index.jsp: Home page with navigation links.
    .register.jsp: Registration form for new users.
    .register_sucess.jsp: Confirms successful registration.
    .list_users.jsp: Displays a list of all registered users with options to update or delete.
    .update_user.jsp: Form for updating an existing userâ€™s details.
4. Technical Notes
    .Spring Boot: Used for building the standalone web application.
    .Spring MVC: Implements the MVC pattern for separating concerns.
    .Spring Data JPA: Provides an abstraction layer for database interactions.
    .Bootstrap: Enhances the visual styling of the web pages.
    .JSP and JSTL: For rendering dynamic content in the views.
5. Flow of the Application
    1. Registration: Users can register via the registration form. Upon submission, the data is processed and stored in the database.
    2. List Users: Users can view a list of all registered users.
    3 .Update User: Allows modification of user details by fetching user data into a form.
    4. Delete User: Enables the deletion of user records.
